This is a GitHub Action that given an organization, team, or specified repositories, opens an issue/PR if dependabot is not enabled, or there are more package ecosystems that could be added. It also enables [automated security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates#managing-dependabot-security-updates-for-your-repositories) for the repository.

This action was developed by the GitHub OSPO for our own use and developed in a way that we could open source it that it might be useful to you as well! If you want to know more about how we use it, reach out in an issue in this repository.

## Example use cases

- As a part of the security team for my company, I want to make sure that all of the repositories in the company organizations are regularly updating their dependencies to ensure they are using the most secure version of the dependency available.
- As an OSPO or maintainer, I want to automate everything I can to keep maintaining my project(s) easy and efficient.

## Support

If you need support using this project or have questions about it, please [open up an issue in this repository](https://github.com/github/evergreen/issues). Requests made directly to GitHub staff or support team will be redirected here to open an issue. GitHub SLA's and support/services contracts do not apply to this repository.

### OSPO GitHub Actions as a Whole

All feedback regarding our GitHub Actions, as a whole, should be communicated through [issues on our github-ospo repository](https://github.com/github/github-ospo/issues/new).

## Use as a GitHub Action

1. Create a repository to host this GitHub Action or select an existing repository.
1. Select a best fit workflow file from the [examples below](#example-workflows).
1. Copy that example into your repository (from step 1) and into the proper directory for GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/` directory with the file extension `.yml` (ie. `.github/workflows/evergreen.yml`)
1. Edit the values below from the sample workflow with your information:

   - `ORGANIZATION`
   - `TEAM_NAME`
   - `REPOSITORY`
   - `EXEMPT_REPOS`
   - `TYPE`
   - `TITLE`
   - `BODY`

   If running on a whole **organization** then no repository is needed.  
   If running the action on just **one repository** or a **list of repositories**, then no organization is needed.  
   If running the action on a **team**, then an organization is required and no repository is needed.  
   The type should be either `issue` or `pull` representing the action that you want taken after discovering a repository that should enable dependabot.

1. Optionally, edit the value `CREATED_AFTER_DATE` if you are setting up this action to run regularly and only want newly created repositories to be considered.
   Otherwise, if you want all specified repositories regardless of when they were created to be considered, then leave it blank.
1. Optionally edit the value `UPDATE_EXISTING` (default value `false`) if you want to update existing dependabot configuration files.
   If set to `true`, the action will update the existing dependabot configuration file with any package ecosystems that are detected but not configured yet.
   If set to `false`, the action will only create a new dependabot configuration file if there is not an existing one.
1. Also edit the value for `GH_ENTERPRISE_URL` if you are using a GitHub Server and not using github.com.
   For github.com users, leave it empty.
1. Update the value of `GH_TOKEN`. Do this by creating a [GitHub API token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with the following permissions:

   - If using **classic tokens**:
     - `workflow`, this will set also all permissions for `repo`
     - under `admin`, `read:org` and `write:org`
   - If using **fine grain tokens**:
     - `Administration` - Read and Write (Needed to activate the [automated security updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates#managing-dependabot-security-updates-for-your-repositories) )
     - `Pull Requests` - Read and Write (If `TYPE` input is set to `pull`)
     - `Issues` - Read and Write (If `TYPE` input is set to `issue`)
     - `Workflows` - Read and Write (Needed to create the `dependabot.yml` file)

   Then take the value of the API token you just created, and [create a repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) where the name of the secret is `GH_TOKEN` and the value of the secret the API token.
   Then finally update the workflow file to use that repository secret by changing `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to `GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}`.
   The name of the secret can really be anything, it just needs to match between when you create the secret name and when you refer to it in the workflow file.

1. If you want the resulting issue with the output to appear in a different repository other than the one the workflow file runs in, update the line `token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` with your own GitHub API token stored as a repository secret. This process is the same as described in the step above. More info on creating secrets can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
1. Commit the workflow file to the default branch (often `master` or `main`)
1. Wait for the action to trigger based on the `schedule` entry or manually trigger the workflow as shown in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow).

### Configuration

Below are the allowed configuration options:

#### Authentication

This action can be configured to authenticate with GitHub App Installation or Personal Access Token (PAT). If all configuration options are provided, the GitHub App Installation configuration has precedence. You can choose one of the following methods to authenticate:

##### GitHub App Installation

This is useful if you want to only consider newly created repositories. If I set up this action to run weekly and I only want to scan for repos created in the last week that need dependabot enabled, then I would set `CREATED_AFTER_DATE` to 7 days ago. That way only repositories created after 7 days ago will be considered for dependabot enablement. If not set or set to nothing, all repositories will be scanned and a duplicate issue/pull request may occur. Ex: 2023-12-31 for Dec. 31st 2023 |

### Private repositories configuration

Dependabot allows the configuration of [private registries](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries) for dependabot to use.  
To add a private registry configuration to the dependabot file the `DEPENDABOT_CONFIG_FILE` needs to be set with the path of the configuration file.

This configuration file needs to exist on the repository where the action runs. It can also be created locally to test some configurations (if created locally it takes precedence over the file on the repository).

#### Usage

Set the input variable:

```yaml
DEPENDABOT_CONFIG_FILE = "dependabot-config.yaml"
```

Create a file on your repository in the same path:

```yaml
npm:
  type: "npm"
  url: "https://yourprivateregistry/npm/"
  username: "${{secrets.username}}"
  password: "${{secrets.password}}"
  key: <used if necessary>
  token: <used if necessary>
  replaces-base: <used if necessary>
maven:
  type: "maven"
  url: "https://yourprivateregistry/maven/"
  username: "${{secrets.username}}"
  password: "${{secrets.password}}"
```

The principal key of each configuration need to match the package managers that the [script is looking for](https://github.com/github/evergreen/blob/main/dependabot_file.py#L78).

The `dependabot.yaml` created file will look like the following with the `registries:` key added:

```yaml
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    registries: --> added configuration
      - 'npm'    --> added configuration
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    labels:
      - "test"
      - "dependabot"
      - "new"
```

### Example workflows

        run: |
          # Get the current date
          current_date=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')

          # Calculate the previous month
          previous_date=$(date -d "$current_date -7 day" +'%Y-%m-%d')

          echo "$previous_date..$current_date"
          echo "one_week_ago=$previous_date" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"

      - name: Run evergreen action
        uses: github/evergreen@v1
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ORGANIZATION: <YOUR_ORGANIZATION_GOES_HERE>
          EXEMPT_REPOS: "org_name/repo_name_1, org_name/repo_name_2"
          TITLE: "Add dependabot configuration"
          BODY: "Please add this dependabot configuration so that we can keep the dependencies in this repo up to date and secure. for help, contact XXX"
          CREATED_AFTER_DATE: ${{ env.one_week_ago }}
```

#### Using GitHub app

```yaml
name: Evergreen
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "3 2 * * 6"

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  evergreen:
    name: "Create dependabot.yml"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Run evergreen action for tools
        uses: github/evergreen@v1
        env:
          GH_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
          GH_APP_INSTALLATION_ID: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_INSTALLATION_ID }}
          GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          # GITHUB_APP_ENTERPRISE_ONLY: True --> Set to true when created GHE App needs to communicate with GHE api
          GH_ENTERPRISE_URL: ${{ github.server_url }}
          # GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} --> the token input is not used if the github app inputs are set
          ORGANIZATION: your_organization
          UPDATE_EXISTING: True
          GROUP_DEPENDENCIES: True
```

## Local usage without Docker

1. Make sure you have at least Python3.11 installed
1. Copy `.env-example` to `.env`
1. Fill out the `.env` file with a _token_ from a user that has access to the organization to scan (listed below). Tokens should have at least write:org access for organization scanning and write:repository for repository scanning.
1. Fill out the `.env` file with the configuration parameters you want to use
1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `python3 ./evergreen.py`, which will output everything in the terminal
